# Hover:
The hover state in CSS refers to what happens when a user moves their cursor over an element, like a button or link. It’s a way to change the appearance of an element when the user is interacting with it, helping indicate that it's clickable or interactive. Common hover effects include changing the color, background, or adding shadows.

# Active:
The active state in CSS applies styles to an element when it is being clicked or tapped. It’s used to visually show that a button or link is in the process of being activated, often by changing the element's appearance temporarily during the click.

# Opacity:
Opacity controls the transparency level of an element. A value of 1 means the element is fully visible, while 0 makes it completely invisible. Values between 0 and 1 allow partial transparency. Opacity is useful for creating effects like faded images or making certain parts of the page less prominent.

# Transition:
The transition property allows smooth animation between two states of an element, such as changing its size, color, or position. Instead of an abrupt change, the transition gradually animates the change over a set duration, giving a more polished look to interactions.
